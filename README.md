This is my B.Tech 3rd year project for my Web Technology Course.


It's a chat application that uses socket to connect to multiusers and can allow both single and mult user chat channels.


It is built by me for my basic requirement and not scalable.

It can be used as private chat room especially for a project team etc.

Enjoy the day <3
